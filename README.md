# Mixture of Principal Movements
Dimensional reduction for robotic movements!

TODO LIST
---------
- [ ] Create an interface which can work for (i) real robot (ii) RLBench (iii) human dataset
- [ ] Create a common interface for dimensionality reduction techniques
- [ ] Apply dimensionality reduction to joint space
- [ ] Apply dimensionality reduction to parameter space
- [ ] Generate the experiments needed, possibly reading the parameters from the command line and saving the results plus a json of the used parameters in a well-organized folder
- [ ] Write bash script to run experiments!
